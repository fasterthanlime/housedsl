A weak attempt at implementing a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) in ooc.

It's very largely stolen, nay, inspired, from:

http://yonkeltron.com/2010/05/13/creating-a-ruby-dsl/ (what did you expect?)

However, I'm not entirely happy about it. At first I thought about using
|this| instead of make to have calls like 'room()' instead of 'make room()'
but rock didn't like that, and modifying it to support it would've been cheating..

Although I'm pretty sure this can be improved upon with the current
compiler versions, and I encourage everyone to try and beat me at it =)
